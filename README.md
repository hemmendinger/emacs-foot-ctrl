===============

Adapting a foot pedal to simulate CTRL when released for improved ergonomics.

I believe that it is best if the foot were to always rest on the pedal.
If a user has to hold their foot above the pedal without pressing it,
it results in unnecessary strain, especially if most of the time you are not
going to be pushing CTRL. 

So it is likely best if the neutral position was when the pedal is pressed,
and the active position is a release. Or it's just my personal preference.
